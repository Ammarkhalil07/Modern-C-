## Why Should You Take This Course?

>  C++ has a big overlap in syntax. The standards of C++ are also very long, and still in evolution to accept new features. This course will not cover all aspects of C++. It is impossible. The course focuses on the most important and unique parts of C++. Pointers and memory management will be described and explained almost through all chapters. They make many beginners even experienced developers crazy for bugs difficult to find. But they are important for computing efficiently, and also are the unique advantages C++. Some people hate them, and some love them. We can say pointers and memory management makes C++ unique to most other advanced programming languages.
